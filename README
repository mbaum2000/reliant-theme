The Reliant Desktop Theme

This theme contains an icon set, based off of elementary, and a metacity theme
based off of an old version of Clearlooks (technically, the Ubuntu Human theme,
which was based off of Clearlooks is used as a base.

The icon theme mostly borrows icons from older versions of elementary, as well
as a few older GNOME icon themes, among others, with a few adjustments and
tweaks to some.  For specifics of which icons were taken from where, refer to
the COPYRIGHT file.
